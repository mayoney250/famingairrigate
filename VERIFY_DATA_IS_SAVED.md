## 📊 Expected Results Summary

### Firebase Console → Authentication → Users:

- After Step 3: Should show `test456@example.com` too

### Firebase Console → Firestore → Data:
```
├── users/
│   ├── ABC123... (test123@example.com user)

### Browser Console (F12):
Should show logs with emojis:
- 🚀 = Starting an operation

- 📝 = Data being processed

---

## 🚨 If You See Errors

### Error: "permission-denied"
```
❌ Error creating field: [cloud_firestore/permission-denied]
```

**Solution:**
Your Firestore rules are blocking writes. Make sure:
1. Rules are published in Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules tab
2. Wait 30 seconds after publishing
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### Error: "User not logged in"
```
Failed to create field: User not logged in
```

**Solution:**
- Log out and log back in
- Make sure you're on the dashboard after login
- Check console for: `✅ Sign in successful! UID: ...`

### No logs appearing in console
**Solution:**
- Make sure you pressed `F12` and switched to **Console** tab
- Make sure filter is set to "All levels" (not just errors)
- Try `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` → Clear cached images → Reload app
