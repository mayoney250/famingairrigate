## Quick Test (5 minutes) 🧪

### Step 1: Add Test Data
In Firebase Console → Firestore → `irrigationSchedules`:

```json
{
  "userId": "YOUR_USER_ID",
  "name": "Test - Stop Feature",
  "zoneId": "test_field_1",
  "zoneName": "Test Field",
  "startTime": "2025-01-27T10:00:00.000Z",
  "durationMinutes": 30,
  "repeatDays": [],
  "isActive": true,
  "status": "running",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-27T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Step 2: Test in App
1. **Hot restart the app** (press 'R' in terminal or restart)
2. Navigate to **Irrigation** screen (water drop icon)
3. You should see the test schedule with:
   - ✅ Green "RUNNING" status badge
   - ✅ Red "Stop Irrigation" button
4. Tap "Stop Irrigation"
5. Confirm in the dialog
6. Watch it change to:
   - ✅ Orange "STOPPED" status
   - ✅ No stop button (already stopped)

### Step 3: Verify in Firestore
Check that the document was updated with:
- `status: "stopped"`
- `isActive: false`
- `stoppedAt: [timestamp]`
- `stoppedBy: "manual"`
