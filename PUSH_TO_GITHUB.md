## ✅ Changes Committed Locally

## 🔐 Authentication Required

To push to GitHub, you need proper authentication:

### Step 1: Create Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Token name: `Faminga Irrigation App`
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you'll only see it once!)

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git push origin main
```

When prompted:
- **Username**: Your GitHub username (mayoney250 or famingaltd)
- **Password**: Paste your Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)

### Step 3: Verify Push

After successful push, verify at:
```
https://github.com/mayoney250/famingairrigate
```

## 🔄 Alternative: Change Repository Owner

If you want to push to your own account instead:

```bash
# Check current remote
git remote -v

# Change to your repository
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/famingairrigate.git

# Push to your repository
git push origin main
```

## ⚠️ Repository Access Issue?

If you see: `Permission denied to famingaltd`

**This means:**
- The repository `mayoney250/famingairrigate` is owned by `mayoney250`
- User `famingaltd` doesn't have push access

**Solutions:**

### Option A: Get Added as Collaborator
Ask the repository owner (`mayoney250`) to:
1. Go to: https://github.com/mayoney250/famingairrigate/settings/access
2. Click **"Add people"**
3. Add your GitHub username: `famingaltd`
4. Grant **"Write"** access

### Option B: Fork the Repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/mayoney250/famingairrigate
2. Click **"Fork"** button (top right)
3. This creates a copy under your account
4. Change remote:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/famingaltd/famingairrigate.git
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option C: Use SSH Instead of HTTPS
```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "akariclaude@gmail.com"

# Add SSH key to GitHub
# Copy the public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Add it at: https://github.com/settings/keys

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:mayoney250/famingairrigate.git

# Push
git push origin main
```

2. ✅ Check the commit appears in the history
