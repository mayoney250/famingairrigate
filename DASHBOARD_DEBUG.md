# Dashboard Not Loading - Debug Steps

## Issue
The dashboard is not loading after adding the manual stop irrigation feature.

## Likely Cause
The changes to `IrrigationScheduleModel` added new required fields (`status`, `stoppedAt`, `stoppedBy`) that existing Firestore documents don't have, causing deserialization errors.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
Press `F12` in Chrome and look at the Console tab. Look for:
- Red error messages
- Stack traces mentioning "IrrigationScheduleModel"
- Firestore errors

### 2. Temporary Solution - Clear Irrigation Data
If you have test irrigation schedules causing issues:

**Option A: Delete in Firestore Console**
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Open `irrigationSchedules` collection
4. Delete any test documents
5. Refresh the app

**Option B: Add Missing Fields**
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Open each document in `irrigationSchedules`
3. Add these fields:
   ```
   status: "scheduled"
   stoppedAt: null
   stoppedBy: null
   ```

### 3. Check the Error in Dashboard Provider
The dashboard provider has try-catch blocks that might be hiding errors. Look for log messages in the console like:
- "Error loading dashboard data: ..."
- "Error loading next schedule: ..."

### 4. Test Without Irrigation Data
The dashboard should still load even if there's no irrigation schedule. If it's completely blank, the issue is elsewhere.

## Verification Steps

1. **Open Browser Console (F12)**
2. **Look for errors like:**
   ```
   FormatException: Invalid string
   type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'String'
   Expected a value of type 'Timestamp'
   ```

3. **Check if the loading indicator appears**
   - If you see "Loading dashboard..." spinner = Provider is working
   - If screen is blank = Bigger issue with routing or providers

## Expected Behavior

The dashboard SHOULD:
- Show loading spinner initially
- Load even if no irrigation schedules exist
- Show "No Scheduled Irrigation" if there are no schedules
- Still display weather, soil moisture, and weekly stats

## If Dashboard Still Won't Load

### Emergency Rollback
If you need the app working immediately, we can temporarily disable the irrigation schedule loading:

1. Comment out the irrigation schedule loading in dashboard_provider.dart:
   ```dart
   // await _loadNextSchedule(userId),  // COMMENTED OUT
   ```

2. Hot restart the app

This will let the dashboard load without irrigation data while we fix the issue.
