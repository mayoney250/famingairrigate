# Faminga Irrigation - Quick Start Guide

## ‚ö° Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Enable Developer Mode (Windows Only)

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
start ms-settings:developers
```
Then toggle "Developer Mode" to ON.

### Step 2: Check Flutter Installation

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Make sure all checkmarks are green. If not, follow the instructions provided.

### Step 3: Navigate to Project

```bash
cd d:\irrigation\faminga_irrigation
```

### Step 4: Get Dependencies (Already Done!)

Dependencies are already installed, but if you need to reinstall:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 5: Generate Localization

```bash
flutter gen-l10n
```

### Step 6: Configure Firebase (REQUIRED BEFORE RUNNING)

#### Option A: Quick Test (Mock Setup - NOT RECOMMENDED)
For initial testing only, you can temporarily comment out Firebase initialization in `main.dart`:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // TODO: Uncomment after Firebase setup
  // await FirebaseConfig.initialize();
  
  runApp(const FamingaIrrigationApp());
}
```

#### Option B: Proper Firebase Setup (RECOMMENDED)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create new project: "Faminga Irrigation"
3. Add Android app:
   - Package name: `com.faminga.irrigation`
   - Download `google-services.json`
   - Place in: `android/app/google-services.json`

4. Add iOS app (if developing for iOS):
   - Bundle ID: `com.faminga.irrigation`
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`

5. Enable Authentication:
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method
   - Enable "Email/Password"

6. Enable Firestore:
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Create database (Start in production mode)

7. Update `lib/config/firebase_config.dart` with your credentials

### Step 7: Run the App

```bash
# List available devices
flutter devices

# Run on connected device
flutter run

# Or run on specific device
flutter run -d <device_id>

# Run in release mode
flutter run --release
